See open research statement for model source code and data sources of inputs, grid, and forcing 
files needed to recreate the simulations.

Descriptions of input and forcing files can be found in the COAWST, ROMS, and WRF-Hydro manuals.

All simulations were run within the open-source modeling system COAWST:
